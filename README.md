# Final Project group 11 â€“ Algorithms in Bioinformatics: Gibbs sampler

## Abstract
Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules (MHCs) are 
expressed on the surface of professional antigen-presenting 
cells where they display peptides to T helper cells, which 
orchestrate the onset and outcome of many host immune 
responses. Predicting which peptide sequences will be 
presented by the MHC II molecule is therefore important
for understanding the activation of T helper cells and 
can be used for the rational design of novel vaccines. 
In the present work, the Gibbs sampling approach with or 
without sequence clustering using different methods 
(Hobohm1, Hobohm2 or heuristic sequence weighting) 
is presented to predict MHC class II peptide sequences 
with a high binding affinity. Finally the results were 
displayed in terms of Pearsons Correlation Coefficient 
(PCC), a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC curves) 
and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metrics and 
visualized as sequence logos with potential motifs. It 
can be concluded that the PCC, MCC and AUC metrics are 
consistently poor for each allele between the applied 
methods, which is also observed in the study conducted 
by Nielsen \textit{et al.} in 2007. The Gibbs approach 
with heuristic sequence weighting has shown to find the 
most conserved motifs among the applied methods.
