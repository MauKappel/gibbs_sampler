# Final Project group 11 â€“ Algorithms in Bioinformatics: Gibbs sampler

## Introduction
Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules (MHCs) are expressed on the surface of profes-
sional antigen-presenting cells where they display peptides to T helper cells, which orchestrate
the onset and outcome of many host immune responses. Predicting which peptides sequences
will be presented by the MHC-II molecule is therefore important for understanding the activa-
tion of T helper cells and can be used for the rational design of novel vaccines. Here we present a
computational tool to predict sequences which will likely be presented by the MHC-II molecule
and the methods to construct it. A Gibbs sampler was developed to predict novel binding motifs
for MHC-II molecules. Methods for reduction of data redundancy and application of sequence
weighing were used to study their effect on the model performance. Finally the results were
visualized using sequence logos, to visualize the rationale of the model.
